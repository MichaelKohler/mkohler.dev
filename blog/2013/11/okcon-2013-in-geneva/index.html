  <h1>OKCon 2013 in Geneva</h1>
  <p class="date">2013-11-03 at 12:39:52</p>

  <p>Mid of September I attended the <a href="http://okcon.org/">Open Knowledge Conference 2013</a> in Geneva. To be honest, I had never heard of the Open Knowledge Foundation before (or I just don't recall), so I was quite happy to see that this year's conference was in Geneva.  I just found out about it, because <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/kaythaney/">Kaitlin Thaney</a>, Director Mozilla Science Lab had a talk there.</p>
<p>I had heard of Open Data and seen some examples before, but I didn't know, that there was a whole conference about it. Open Data, Open Government, Open Science, you name it. I tried to go to an <a href="http://opendata.ch/">OpenData.ch</a> event last spring, but unfortunately I couldn't make it. Otherwise I would have been involved with OpenData before, since it's a great cause. At the Open Knowledge Conference the Swiss government announced their <a href="http://opendata.admin.ch/">Open Data Portal</a>, which (in my opinion) needs a lot of improvement and more different datasets.</p>
<p>Since OpenData has a strong correlation with the Open Web Mozilla wants to build, I was there talking to people about the Open Web and Mozilla's Mission. Also I talked with people about Mozilla Webmaker to show them how easy it can be to publish their data with the Webmaker tools. One problem I was faced with was that the event registration was sponsored and so everybody had the same (sponsored) lanyard. Since I had Firefox lanyards with me, I couldn't just go there and tell everyone to switch them. Or could I have? In my opinion that would have been quite unpolite. Nevertheless I handed out the lanyards, but didn't ask them to switch them instantly (but some of them did on their own).</p>
<p>I met a lot of inspiring persons with whom I will get in contact shortly to create more events to get the general public more aware about Open Data and the Web.</p>
