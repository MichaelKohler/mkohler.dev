  <h1>Million Mask March Zurich - 08.11.2014</h1>
  <p class="date">2014-11-20 at 21:35:03</p>

  <p>On the 8th of November (yes, 2 days before #fx10), we met in Zurich to provide a tea booth for protesters. There is a new law coming up in Switzerland which would negatively influence everybody's privacy, which was the reason for the protest. A few days before the event I asked Martin and Gion-Andri from the Swiss community if they'd like to help out with the tea since two other members couldn't make it that day. Fortunately they said yes and did a great job!</p>

<p>Reminder for everyone who wants to serve tea some time: cooking 28 liters of water for the tea is easy. It took us only about an hour to finish the tea. But since nobody of us is allowed to drive a car (we don't need to have a car in Switzerland), we had to think about transportation. Since we also had to transport a table we needed a car and couldn't use public transport. We didn't find anybody with a car, so we took a taxi. The taxi driver did a great job driving steady to not spill anything. Making any other driver believe that it's a weird taxi driver driving so slowly? We did it!</p>

<p>There we're about 80 to 100 people attending. Since Switzerland is quite cold these days, our tea was greatly appreciated. We had a great evening and we're surprised how many people don't know the values of Mozilla. We need to have more events like this and show that Mozilla stands for Privacy.</p>
