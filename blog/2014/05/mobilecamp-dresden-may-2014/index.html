  <h1>MobileCamp Dresden May 2014</h1>
  <p class="date">2014-05-26 at 22:58:32</p>

  <p>On the 10th May I went to the MobileCamp in Dresden, Germany to give a keynote about Firefox OS. One of our community members was asked if Mozilla wants to do the keynote and we thought that this is a great opportunity to tell people in Germany about our mission and our goals we have with Firefox OS.</p>
<h2>Keynote</h2>
<p>I held the keynote right after the introduction and session planning on Monday morning. I talked about our Mission, why we're doing Firefox OS and the current state of it. At the end I gave a quick overview of new features to come. After the keynote a few people instantly came to me and asked if they could play with my Firefox OS devices.</p>
<p>You can find the slides here: <a href="http://bit.ly/mobilecamp-firefoxos">http://bit.ly/mobilecamp-firefoxos</a></p>
<h2>Saturday evening</h2>
<p>On Saturday evening we went to the City Beach in Dresden and we talked about the mobile world and what the future will hold. Once again I could show Firefox OS to the people there and the general feedback was quite good.</p>
<p>Later I met Laura Hilliger and Henrik Skupin to get some drinks and catch up. It was great to talk to local Mozillians.</p>
<h2>Rest of the barcamp</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I wasn't very well, so I didn't do a second session. Appmaker would be a great thing to have a session on, but there will be another MobileCamp next year or other barcamps in the German speaking countries. I'll definitely keep that in mind.</p>
<p>There were a lot of other, very interesting sessions as well. In some I could provide my view from the &quot;Firefox OS&quot; view point, which led to great discussions.</p>
<p>One guy was very impressed when he experienced the keyboard and noticed that the vibration feedback is instant. I then explained that this is done using the Vibration API.</p>
<p>In conclusion this was a great event and I could have nice discussions about Firefox OS and its eco system.</p>
