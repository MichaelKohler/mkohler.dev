  <h1>Mozilla Hacking Day 2 - 11.10.2014</h1>
  <p class="date">2014-11-20 at 21:32:40</p>

  <p>On the 11th of October we organized a &quot;Mozilla Hacking Day 2&quot; in Berlin. This was the follow up of the first Hacking Day in Berlin in April.</p>
<p>On Friday we met and went to dinner and talked about the next day. Since we had to wake up early on Saturday we didn't stay up long (<em>cough</em>). On Saturday we had a quick delay since we couldn't have our room at TU Berlin yet at 9am. Fortunately we could have it at 9:30am and had interesting talks before that while waiting. This was organized together with <a href="http://meshcon.net/">MeshCon</a>, so we could talk to a lot of people that generally don't get in touch with Mozilla.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3956/14931192133_c3c0114762.jpg" alt="Table picture"></p>
<p>We devided the tables into &quot;Firefox&quot;, &quot;Firefox OS&quot;, &quot;Firefox Addons&quot; and &quot;Other&quot;. All hacking tables had attendees present. Many of them didn't know what to hack on, so we helped them out. Someone asked me about Popcorn.js and I could show him how to fix a bug (he found it himself!) in Popcorn Maker. On the other tables people were busy hacking on other stuff. I think most people enjoyed this day.</p>

<p>At lunch we had great quiches from Florian, who suggested to cook them for us. These were amazing, thanks again to you, Florian!</p>

<p>From the around 35 attendees, 2 said that they will continue contributing to Mozilla (Add-ons) and one even registered to be an add-on reviewer.</p>
<p>According to the feedback we have decided the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More specific hackathons (for example &quot;Firefox Hacking&quot;)</li>
<li>Since we didn't do any localization there will be a localization sprint next year</li>
<li>It's hard to get feedback (only 4 people have filled out the form) - how can we improve that?</li>
<li>The next time, prepare a &quot;Good First Bug&quot; list beforehand instead of using the bugzilla search</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it was a great day and we'll certainly provide this opportunity to learn in 2015.</p>
