  <h3>Why Mozilla?</h3>
  <p>
    I&apos;ve always been interested in the Open Web since I started creating my
    first websites. Mozilla’s mission is ​to &quot;ensure the Internet is a global
    public resource, open and accessible to all&quot;. This resonates with me very
    well because a lot of my knowledge comes from research on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started to use Firefox around version 1 and never have switched since then.
    In the beginning I was using the release channel. After my math teacher in
    high school introduced us to Mozilla and what he is working on for Firefox
    (he wrote the initial code for Session Restore) I was hooked and started to
    use the nightly build and report bugs. Soon after that I wrote my first patch
    to improve the sorting the bookmarks backup menu. Since then I have written
    patches, started to bring Swiss Mozillians together, went as far as Germany
    and Austria to help build the German speaking community and nowadays
    I&apos;m also involved in the Mozilla Reps (Representative) program.
