Our backup application "BackupSoft" is now officially available for download. You can download it on the "Downloads" page of this website. Currently there is only the Linux version available, because the Windows version takes up to 50MB. I'm sorry you need to compile it for yourself. You need to download the linux version if you want to have the source code. Further Qt needs to be installed.
