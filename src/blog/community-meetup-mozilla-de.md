**TL;DR:** Great meetup, let's work on our defined goals for 2014!

On the 8th of February 2014 we had our second "German-speaking Mozilla Community" Meetup after rebooting the community. In this blog post I'd like to review the event and tell you about our 2014 goals.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Not 100% achieved 2013 goals

*   Not a lot of new faces on this year's meetup
*   Even though there was a lot going on, the coordination within the groups was not great. Also overall communication can be improved.
*   "Contribute" form is hard to process -> almost no visible new contributors
*   It's hard to find new contributors for Marketing and Localization
We splitted up in different groups: L10N/Support, Hacking and a "miscellaneous" group.

## Let's review our goals for 2014

### L10N/Support

*   Goal: Find more contributors
*   Goal: Improve the German articles on SUMO, MDN
*   Goal: Improve the German translation of Firefox, Firefox OS
*   Solution: organize different Sprints during the year. The next sprint will be on the [5th and 6th of April](https://mozilla.github.io/reps-archive/e/docsprint-berlin-april-2014/) in Berlin
**Hacking:**

*   Goal: Find more contributors
*   Solution: organize multiple "Mozilla Hacking Days". The next event will be on the [26th of April in Berlin](https://mozilla.github.io/reps-archive/e/mozilla-hacking-day-germany/) (to be definitely confirmed)
*   Solution: use the momentum of the first Hacking Day to organize a second Hacking Day. At the second event we fully go "non-Mozillians", i.e. as many interested, possible contributors as possible
**Miscellaneous:**

### Firefox OS

*   Goal: find new app developers and create localized apps
*   Goal: promote Firefox OS in Germany
*   Solution: organize multiple Firefox OS App Days in Germany/Austria/Switzerland
*   Firefox OS App Day Zurich (planning ongoing)
*   Firefox OS App Day Vienna (planning ongoing)
*   Firefox OS App Day Munich (planning pending)
*   Other Firefox OS App Days to be specified
Marketing:

*   Goal: find new contributors for posts on Twitter, Facebook, ...
*   Solution: probably use already existing contributors in other areas
Webmaker:

*   Goal: organize multiple Webmaker events in Germany, Austria and Switzerland
*   Goal: organize a OpenBadges event in Switzerland
*   Goal: organize a "All Things Web" bi-weekly course in Switzerland (probably in cooperation with the Open Tech School)
*   Solution: Meeting with Michelle Thorne on the 4th of April to discuss the ideas

The different groups will inform about the progress in the #deMeeting on the 5th of March.

## Community Building Brainstorming
At the end of the day we had a **"Community Building"** session. Here's the outcome/brainstorming:

*   Use badges for contributors
*   Identify Student Ambassadors in Germany
*   Response to "Contribute" form needs to be edited
*   Reach out to other tech communities to find new contributors
*   Better integration of Mozilla employees
*   Inform other communities about our next events (JS groups, user groups, ...)
*   Big Mozilla Hacking Days (see above)
