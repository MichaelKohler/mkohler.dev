At the German-speaking community [meetup in February](http://www.michaelkohler.info/2015/mozilla-german-speaking-community-meetup-2015-day1) we set some goals to reach in 2015\. In our [last bi-weekly meeting](https://air.mozilla.org/german-speaking-community-bi-weekly-meeting-20150423/) we discussed the current status of those goals. Here's a quick summary:

<!-- excerpt -->

## Completed

*   Write to all "Localizers in Training" that have added themselves to the wiki and were never contacted -> done, but no feedback yet
*   Finish l10n documentation for beginners -> [live on the wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Teams:de/Dokumentation)
*   Overall year goal SUMO: 90% of all articles (top 100) should always be updated and translated -> we're currently at 100%
*   Overall year goal SUMO: for Firefox releases the top 100 articles should always be finished -> we're currently at 100% for all releases since then
*   Better format for the meeting -> completely done and more efficient with the new Vidyo bi-weekly format ([Meeting notes](https://wiki.mozilla.org/De/Meetings))
**Working on it:**

*   Community Tile -> mockup and first implementation (though not completely finished) got nice feedback, will finish the design by end of week so we can finish the wording
*   Organize Mozilla Weekend -> planning has started
*   Continue Rust meetups -> last one was on April 1 and there will be further meetups
*   Recruit 5 new Mozilla developers -> working on it
*   at least 10 FSA until end of year -> Brainstorming meeting with TJ on May 7
*   2 new Reps to cover more regions and distribute work load -> Jan showed interest
*   Visual identity -> voting for a nice motive is done, we have two "winners" (mountains and "language borders"). We'll come up with a few mockups and vote on them
*   Events in 5 cities where we never had an event before -> we have 2 invitations to events in Worms and Karlsruhe
*   Transfer websites/forums to Community IT -> blocked from Community IT side, [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1119329)

## TODO

*   OrganizeÂ Add-ons SDK talk
*   Start meetups in Berlin to grow the local community there -> we have postponed that to after the Mozilla Weekend due to time contstraints
*   WoMoz -> we didn't define this measurable, but we'll try to start something at Mozilla Weekend if possible
*   Update mozilla.de content

## Not defined as goal, but still happening

*   Robert, Philipp and Arpad will start a Vienna (AT) meetup group \o/
*   Monthly meetups in Zurich (CH) and (about bi-monthly, informal) Bern (CH) by Mozilla Switzerland
