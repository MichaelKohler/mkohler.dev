    I'm a passionate Mozillian volunteering in different areas of Mozilla.

  <h3>
    Why Mozilla?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I've always been interested in the Open Web since I started creating my first websites. Mozilla’s mission is ​to "ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all". This resonates with me very well because a lot of my knowledge comes from research on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started to use Firefox around version 1 and never have switched since then. In the beginning I was using the release channel. After my math teacher in high school introduced us to Mozilla and what he is working on for Firefox (he wrote the initial code for Session Restore) I was hooked and started to use the nightly build and report bugs. Soon after that I wrote my first patch to improve the sorting the bookmarks backup menu. Since then I have written patches, started to bring Swiss Mozillians together, went as far as Germany and Austria to help build the German speaking community and nowadays I'm also involved in the Mozilla Reps (Representative) program.
